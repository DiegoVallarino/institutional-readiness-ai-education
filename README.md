This repository provides the replication materials for the paper:

**"Institutional Readiness for AI in Education: Inequality, Governance, and Learning Trajectories in Latin America"**

## Overview

The paper does not rely on individual-level or confidential data and does not conduct econometric estimation. All quantitative illustrations are generated using calibrated synthetic trajectories designed to discipline and illustrate the conceptual framework developed in the manuscript.

## Repository structure

- `code/`  
  Python scripts used to generate the stylised educational trajectories.

- `data/`  
  Calibrated parameters used in the trajectory construction.

- `figures/`  
  Output figures generated by the scripts.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the main figure, run the following command from the `code/` directory:

```text
python generate_figure2.py
```

The script generates the figure in the `figures/` directory.

## Scope and limitations

The materials provided here are intended for transparency and reproducibility of the illustrative figures only. They do not constitute an empirical dataset and should not be interpreted as estimated or causal results.
